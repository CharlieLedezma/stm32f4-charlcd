# STM32F4 character LCD interface demo

This is a small project in order to interface the stm32f4 with a small character LCD.

It is not particularly fancy in any way, but it should get the job done in some cases.

The work in this project will likely be used in creating a small computer type system, using this character LCD code for display.

If you're interested in using the same display that I have used for testing with this, it can be found [here](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/lcd-204-characters-white-back-light-p-350.html?cPath=163_164), it's not the cheapest, but it does look nice and it's easy to find plenty of documenation on it from the site.

# ENJOY!
